    <p class="bio"> A 29 y/o Audio Engineer/House Flipper turned Web Developer. I have an expertise in smashed vocals, smashed burgers, smashed objects, and smashed keys. A full smash of skills! At this point I have only just begun my projected course to total coding but my core values that drive me towards that goala are Family, Community, Innovation, Creativity and Work/Life Balance. With the new skills I develop I hope to be able to help others and fuel the creative gene I have stoked my whole life. I have a always been keen to what goes on in the different worlds of coding and I'm excited for the next few decades doing it. There is a few things that really catch my attention when it comes to LOVING developement, mainly it's the fact that it is constantly evolving and you have the chance to learn something new and create something new everyday.</p>
